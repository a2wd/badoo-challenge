Problems solved for the badoo challenge Dec 2015

## Format & problems
The challenge is detailed at [http://challenge.badoo.com/info](http://challenge.badoo.com/info), a series of problems to be solved
with the solutions submitted not actual code.

For obvious reasons, this repository will not contain actual solutions until after the event is closed on 14th Dec 2015.

Initially, it will be set up to provide a boiler plate template-code for the event

## Current approach
Having initially experimented with node & Java, it would seem faster and more conducive to quick iteration to implement solutions
in ECMAScript, however this could be due to unfamiliarity with Java, though the extra compilation step definitely increases time
taken to find a solution.
